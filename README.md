### Hi! Nice to meet you (again) 👋
I'm Khoi, I am a senior student in Artificial Intelligence.
I'm currently working on an object-counting project, including:
  - 📷 Building a dataset, in a concise field of objects, obviously.
  - 🔬 Fine-tuning a YOLO model(and any other competitor).

More about me:
