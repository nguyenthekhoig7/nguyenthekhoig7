# Hi! Nice to meet you (again) 👋
I'm Khoi, I am a senior student in **Artificial Intelligence**.

I'm currently working on an object-counting project, including:
  - Building a dataset, in a concise field of objects, obviously.
  - Fine-tuning a YOLO model(and any other competitor).


**🗂️ More about me:**  [`[My resume]`](https://nguyenthekhoig7.github.io/nguyenthekhoig7/TheKhoi_Resume_20231108.pdf)
